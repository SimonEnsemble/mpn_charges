    a = adjacency_matrix(crystal, apply_pbc)

Compute the adjacency matrix `a` of the crystal, where `a[i, j]` is the
distance between atom `i` and `j`. This matrix is symmetric. If `apply_pbc` is `true`, 
periodic boundary conditions are applied when computing the distance.

# Arguments
* `crystal::Crystal`: crystal structure
* `apply_pbc::Bool` whether or not to apply periodic boundary conditions when computing the distance

# Returns
* `a::Array{Float64, 2}`: symmetric, square adjacency matrix with zeros on the diagonal

    ids_neighbors, xs, rs = neighborhood(crystal, i, r, am)

Find and characterize the neighborhood of atom `i` in the crystal `crystal`.
A neighboorhood is defined as all atoms within a distance `r` from atom `i`.
The adjacency matrix `am` is used to find the distances of all other atoms in the crystal from atom `i`.

# Returns
* `ids_neighbors::Array{Int, 1}`: indices of `crystal.atoms` within the neighborhood of atom `i`.
* `xs::Array{Array{Float64, 1}, 1}`: array of Cartesian positions of the atoms surrounding atom `i`. 
the nearest image convention has been applied to find the nearest periodic image. also, the coordinates of atom `i`
have been subtracted off from these coordinates so that atom `i` lies at the origin of this new coordinate system.
The first vector in `xs` is `[0, 0, 0]` corresponding to atom `i`.
the choice of type is for the Voronoi decomposition in Scipy. 
* `rs::Array{Float64, 1}`: list of distances of the neighboring atoms from atom `i`.
